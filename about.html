    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
        Ah Hello there! <br>
        My name is Anthony. I would first like to thank you for looking at this repository of mine and second I know you are looking at this due to it being an about me page so let me talk about myself a bit.<br>
        I am 21 years old at the moment, almost 22, I have a pretty curious mind that is also a bit random as well so I may go from being interested in something like AI and somehow end up on how to build a whole super computer, and yes I am someone who does enjoy a bit of humor and being goofy as well. Your day is never complete without a smile or some kind of joke. <br>
        Anyways, I am also a part of a very amazing program called Hikima which is teaching me about all sorts of cool things in the IT field such as web and app development, Aws, cyber secruity, linux and Databases, which is pretty cool if i must say so.(Yes, I will shamelessy hype them up cuz they deserve it) <br>
   </p>
    <p>
        Alright so there was that little bit about me...sorta but hey you now know a bit more about me as well as the awesome program that is Hikima(Yes, I will keep mentioning them just because I can lol I'm having a bit too much fun typing this)
    </p>
